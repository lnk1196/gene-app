Coexpression between genes was examined with String, and a network was then constructed. Relevant pathways and diseases were retrieved with KOBAS. A total of 56 DEGs were obtained in the IDC of the breast compared with normal controls. A gene coexpression network including 27 pairs of genes was constructed and all the genes in the network were upregulated. Further study indicated that most of the genes in the coexpression network were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction (COL4A2, FN1, and HMMR) and nucleotide excision repair (CETN2 and PCNA) pathways, and that the most significantly related disease was autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes. A number of DEGs were acquired through comparative analysis of gene expression data. These findings are beneficial in promoting the understanding of the molecular mechanisms in breast cancer. More importantly, some key genes were revealed via gene coexpression network analysis, which could be potential biomarkers for IDC of the breast.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25726004/'>Effect of Sodium Fluoride on the Proliferation and Gene Differential Expression in Human RPMI8226 Cells.</a> April 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25725991/'>IL-25 as a novel therapeutic target in nasal polyps of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.</a> August 13  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25725990/'>Key stages of bone marrow B-cell maturation are defective in patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders.</a> October 23  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25725987/'>Characterization of a high TNF-Î± phenotype in children with moderate-to-severe asthma.</a> August 13  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901318/'>Functional and mechanistic studies of XPC DNA-repair complex as transcriptional coactivator in embryonic stem cells.</a> August 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26225671/'>Binding Pattern Elucidation of NNK and NNAL Cigarette Smoke Carcinogens with NER Pathway Enzymes: an Onco- Informatics Study.</a> May 11  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26225655/'>Targeted Resequencing of 30 Genes Improves the Detection of Deleterious Mutations in South Indian Women with Breast and/or Ovarian Cancers.</a> May 6  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26225653/'>Serum 8 Hydroxydeoxyguanosine and Cytotoxin Associated Gene A as Markers for Helicobacter pylori Infection.</a> May 6  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27328943/'>Ciliopathy-associated IQCB1/NPHP5 protein is required for mouse photoreceptor outer segment formation.</a> June 23  2016<br></body></html>
