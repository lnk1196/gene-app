The associations with the risk of asthma, skin-test reactivity and total serum IgE levels were analyzed. Using statistical analyses for association of MCP3 polymorphisms with asthma development and asthma-related phenotypes, no significant signals were detected. In conclusion, we identified four genetic polymorphisms in the important MCP3 gene, but no significant associations of MCP3 variants with asthma phenotypes were detected. MCP3 variation/haplotype information identified in this study will provide valuable information for future association studies of other allergic diseases.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17081610/'>Chemokine-mediated inflammation: Identification of a possible regulatory role for CCR2.</a> November 4  2006<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17178797/'>Expression of immunomodulatory genes in human monocytes induced by voriconazole in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.</a> December 21  2006<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20038492/'>Construction and immunogenicity of Salmonella vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 antigen and MCP3.</a> February 17  2009<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21388664/'>Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP3) promoter polymorphism is associated with atopic asthma in the Indian population.</a> September 13  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21540640/'>Aberrant TGFβ/SMAD4 signaling contributes to epigenetic silencing of a putative tumor suppressor, RunX1T1 in ovarian cancer.</a> October 26  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578274/'>Islet-1 overexpression in human mesenchymal stem cells promotes vascularization through monocyte chemoattractant protein-3.</a> February 11  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27058040/'>Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Trichostatin A and MCP30 Relieve Benzene-Induced Hematotoxicity via Restoring Topoisomerase IIα.</a> August 24  2016<br></body></html>
