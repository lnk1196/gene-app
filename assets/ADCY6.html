Functional annotation indicated that these genes are involved in cellular processes relevant to the cancer phenotype, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair, proteolysis, protease inhibition, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Six of the identified transcripts map to intronic regions of protein-coding genes and may comprise non-annotated exons or as yet uncharacterized long ncRNAs with a regulatory role in the gene expression program of larynx tissue. The differential expression of 10 of these genes (ADCY6, AES, AL2SCR3, CRR9, CSTB, DUSP1, MAP3K5, PLAT, UBL1 and ZNF706) was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Among these, the CSTB gene product has cysteine protease inhibitor activity that has been associated with an antimetastatic function. Interestingly, CSTB showed a low expression in the tumor samples analyzed (p&lt;0.0001). The set of genes identified here contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of larynx cancer, and provide candidate markers for improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this carcinoma.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20656788/'>Genetic variants and abnormal processing of pre-miR-182, a circadian clock modulator, in major depression patients with late insomnia.</a> March 2  2010<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732959/'>Increased blood pressure and hyperdynamic cardiovascular responses in carriers of a common hyperfunctional variant of adenylyl cyclase 6.</a> December 14  2010<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23020224/'>Common genetic variants of the Î²2-adrenergic receptor affect its translational efficiency and are associated with human longevity.</a> April 20  2012<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24319099/'>Mutations in CNTNAP1 and ADCY6 are responsible for severe arthrogryposis multiplex congenita with axoglial defects.</a> December 18  2013<br></body></html>
