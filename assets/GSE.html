&gt;2) with packages in R language. The selected DEGs were further analyzed with bioinformatic methods. After an interaction network of DEGs was constructed by STRING, we selected the most important hub gene through network topological analysis (including node degree, clustering coefficient and path length) and analyzed functions and pathways of the hub gene network. A total of 538 genes were filtered as DEGs between normal and disease samples, and we selected the gene TSPO as the most important hub gene. Among its interactors, the CTSK gene and the IL8 gene participated in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway which is closely related to tumor occurrence. The TSPO gene and its interactors may affect the cancer-specific gene expression by participating in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Our discovery may be useful in investigating the complex interacting mechanisms underlying the disease. However, further experiments are still needed to confirm our result.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24463614/'>Identification of differently expressed genes and small molecule drugs for

Secondly, pathway enrichment analysis for DCGs was performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the DCLs associated with RA were selected by comparing the obtained DCLs with known transcription factor (TF)-targets in the TRANSFAC database. Finally, the obtained TFs were mapped to the known TF-targets to construct the network using cytoscape software. A total of 1755 DEGs, 457 DCGs and 101988 DCLs were achieved and there were 20 TFs in the obtained six TF-target relations (STAT3-TNF, PBX1‑PLAU, SOCS3-STAT3, GATA1-ETS2, ETS1-ICAM4 and CEBPE‑GATA1) and 457 DCGs. A number of TF-target relations in the constructed network were not within DCLs when the TF and target gene were DCGs.

Next, gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichment map Cytoscape plug-in, followed by detecting sub-networks using clusterONE. Finally, risk subpathways were screened using iSubpathwayMiner package. A total of 141 DEGs were screened, including 52 up-regulated ones and 89 down-regulated ones. These DEGs were enriched in 48 GO terms that were mainly related to locomotory behavior, taxis, adhesion, and 11 pathways that were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, as well as several signaling pathways. The enrichment map enriched gene-sets mainly related to cell death and apoptosis, and extracellular components. The risk pathways up-regulated DEGs were exclusively related to arachidonic acid metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and the top two risk pathways were tyrosine metabolism for the down-regulated ones.

These DEGs were enriched in 48 GO terms that were mainly related to locomotory behavior, taxis, adhesion, and 11 pathways that were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, as well as several signaling pathways. The enrichment map enriched gene-sets mainly related to cell death and apoptosis, and extracellular components. The risk pathways up-regulated DEGs were exclusively related to arachidonic acid metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and the top two risk pathways were tyrosine metabolism for the down-regulated ones. From this study we conclude that genes involved in cell death and apoptosis, as well as cell-extracellular matrix interaction, may be essential for OA pathogenesis by altering multiple signaling pathways.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25472581/'>Genome-wide haplotype association study identifies BLM as a risk gene for prostate cancer in Chinese population.</a> July 15

The DEGs were further analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Firstly, DEGs were subject to a hierarchical cluster analysis. Subsequently, the functional enrichment analysis was performed for the common DEGs between the two time periods. Finally, the transcription factors and binding sites of DEGs associated with response to GC stimulus were analyzed. A total of 696 and 949 DEGs were identified at 4 h and 16 h, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that DEG expression was higher in the Dex group than in the control group (P&lt;0.05). A total of 13 significant functions were enriched for the 72 common DEGs at the two time periods. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1) and FAS were associated with the response to GC stimulus and the transcription factor c‑Jun bound to promoter regulation regions of CCL2, DUSP1 and FAS. In conclusion, the transcription factors and binding sites of DEGs associated with the response of LECs to GCs may provide potential gene targets for designing and developing drugs to protect against

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis were performed on the DEGs using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for the DEGs using STRING, and sub-networks were analyzed by Clustering with Overlapping Neighborhood Expansion. A total of 556 DEGs were identified in the cisplatin-sensitive OC cells, of which 246 were upregulated and 310 were downregulated. Functional enrichment analysis revealed metabolism-associated pathways, DNA replication and cell cycle were significantly enriched in the downregulated genes, while cell growth and differentiation, response to stimulus, and apoptosis were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes. A PPI network, including 342 nodes was constructed for the DEGs and four subnetworks were extracted from the entire network. A total of 34 DEGs interacting with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) were identified, which were associated with DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism and cell cycle. In conclusion, a number of key genes and pathways associated with the cisplatin-resistance of OC were revealed, particularly EZH2. These findings assist in the development of therapy for OC.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25951983/'>Global analyses of subtype- or stage-specific genes on chromosome 7 in patients with lung cancer.</a> November 1  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25966254/'>Bioinformatic analysis of the effect of type II diabetes on skin wound healing.</a> February 9  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25963801/'>Screening of candidate genes in fibroblasts derived from patients with Dupuytren's contracture using bioinformatics analysis.</a> March 16  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25982257/'>Latent Pathways Identification by Microarray Expression Profiles in Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Patients.</a> May 14  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25992772/'>Kras activation in p53-deficient myoblasts results in high-grade sarcoma formation with impaired myogenic differentiation.</a> May 14  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997441/'>Identification of genes associated with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma samples based on bioinformatic analysis.</a> May 25  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997411/'>Gene set enrichment analysis of pathways and transcription factors associated with diabetic retinopathy using a microarray dataset.</a> March 25  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26020378/'>Downregulated miR-495 [Corrected] Inhibits the G1-S Phase Transition by Targeting Bmi-1 in Breast Cancer.</a> August 12  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26024876/'>High-density preculture of PBMCs restores defective sensitivity of circulating CD8 T cells to virus- and tumor-derived antigens.</a> October 7  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26035298/'>Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and microRNA regulation of the lung adenocarcinoma transcriptome.</a> April 30  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26036413/'>Corrigendum.</a> June 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26042666/'>Putative regulatory factors associated with intramuscular fat content.</a> May 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26042604/'>Pathway-based gene signatures predicting clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma.</a> March 25  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26045814/'>Interaction of key pathways in sorafenib-treated hepatocellular carcinoma based on a PCR-array.</a> March 30  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26045807/'>P16 and Ki-67 expression improves the diagnostic accuracy of cervical lesions but not predict persistent high risk human papillomavirus infection with CIN1.</a> May 18  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26045806/'>Surfactant protein B gene polymorphisms is associated with risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Chinese Han population.</a> May 18  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26052443/'>Gene Expression Profiling of Ewing Sarcoma Tumors Reveals the Prognostic Importance of Tumor-Stromal Interactions: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group.</a> June 9  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26052094/'>Construction of multi-gene classifier for prediction of response to and prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancers.</a> October 2  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26056378/'>Correspondence of DNA Methylation Between Blood and Brain Tissue and Its Application to Schizophrenia Research.</a> January 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26065883/'>Genome-wide association study for calving performance using high-density genotypes in dairy and beef cattle.</a> March 17  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26081616/'>RNA-seq analysis of lung adenocarcinomas reveals different gene expression profiles between smoking and nonsmoking patients.</a>  2015   &gt;1 in nonsmoker tumor versus normal tissues; 3030 genes in the smoking group; and 1967 genes were common to both groups. Sixty-eight and 70% of the identified genes were downregulated in nonsmoking and smoking groups, respectively. The 20 genes such as SPP1, SPINK1, and FAM83A with largest fold changes in smokers also showed similar large and highly significant fold changes in nonsmokers and vice versa, showing commonalities in expression changes for adenocarcinomas in both smokers and nonsmokers for these genes. We also identified 175 genes that were significantly differently expressed between tumor samples from nonsmoker and smoker patients. Gene expression profile varied substantially between smoker and nonsmoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Smoking patients overall showed far more complicated disease mechanism and have more dysregulation in their gene expression profiles. Our study reveals pathogenetic differences in smoking and nonsmoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma from transcriptome analysis. We provided a list of candidate genes for further study for disease detection and treatment in both smoking and nonsmoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma.<br><a

expression of MYCN.</a>  2015  &gt;1 were selected as cut‑off criteria. Hierarchical clustering analysis and Gene Ontology analysis were respectively performed for the DEGs using the Pheatmap package in R language and The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A protein‑protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed for the DEGs using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. Pathway analysis was performed for the DEGs in the PPI network using the WEB‑based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit. The correlation between MYCN and the key gene associated with MYCN was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In total, 137 downregulated and 35 upregulated DEGs were identified. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that KCNMB4 was involved in the regulation of action potential in neuron term, and the FOS, GLI3 and GLI1 genes were involved in the extracellular matrix‑receptor interaction pathway. The PPI network and correlation analysis revealed that the expression of SOX2 was directly correlated with the expression of MYCN, and the correlation coefficient of SOX2 and MYCN was ‑0.83. Therefore, SOX2, KCNMB4, FOS, GLI3 and GLI1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of NB, with the expression of SOX2 downregulating the expression of MYCN.<br><a

The potential functions of the DEGs were predicted by functional and pathway enrichment analysis with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Furthermore, the interaction associations of the up- and downregulated DEGs obtained from the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database were respectively revealed by the protein-protein interaction networks visualized with Cytoscape. A total of 391 upregulated and 238 downregulated DEGs in were screened in the pituitary adenoma samples. The upregulated DEGs with a higher degree in the protein-protein interaction network (e.g., CCNA2, CCNB1 and CDC20) were significantly involved in cell cycle and cell division. Notably, PTTG1 was enriched in every functional term. These DEGs interacted with each other. The downregulated DEGs (e.g., GABRA1, GABRA4 and GABRB1) also interacted with each other, and were relevant to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction; the DEG POU1F1, interacting with POMC, was correlated with the development of the pituitary gland, adenohypophysis and endocrine system. Certain DEGs, including CCNB1, CCNA2, CDC20, GABRA1, GABRA4, GABRB1, POU1F1 and POMC, and particularly PTTG1, were shown to be closely involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas.<br><a

DETs screened from each disease group were then subjected to functional annotation using DAVID. Next, DETs from each group were used to construct individual interaction networks using the BIND database, followed by sub‑network mining using clusterONE. Significant functions of nodes in each sub‑network were also investigated. In total, 19 and 281 DETs were screened from the RA and OA groups, respectively, with only six common DETs. DETs from the RA and OA groups were enriched in 8 and 130 gene ontology (GO) terms, respectively, with four common GO terms, of which to were associated with phospholipase C (PLC) activity. In addition, DETs screened from the OA group were enriched in immune response‑associated GO terms, and those screened from the RA group were largely associated with biological processes linked with the cell cycle and chromosomes. Genes involved in PLC activity and its regulation were indicated to be altered in RA as well as in OA. Alterations in the expression of cell cycle‑associated genes were indicated to be linked with the occurrence of OA, while genes participating in the immune response were involved in the occurrence of RA.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27082053/'>Identification of microRNA-mRNA interactions in atrial fibrillation using microarray expression profiles and bioinformatics analysis.</a>

After constructing the gene interaction network by STRING with the selected DEGs, we applied a statistical approach to identify the topological hub genes with PageRank score. Forty-four genes were identified in this network and AKT1 was selected as the most important hub gene. The AKT1 gene encodes a serine‑threonine protein kinase (AKT). High expression of AKT is involved in the resistance of cell apoptosis as well as adaptive resistance to treatment in melanoma. Our results indicated that AKT1 with a higher expression in melanoma showed enriched binding sites in the negative regulation of response to external stimulus, which enables cells to adapt to changes in external stimulation for survival. Another finding was that AKT regulated the lipid metabolic process and may be involved in melanoma progression and promotion of tumor growth through gene enrichment function analysis. Two highlighted pathways were detected in our study: i) the estrogen signaling pathway modulates the immune tolerance and resistance to cell apoptosis, which contributes to the growth of melanoma and ii) the RAP1 signaling pathway which regulates focal adhesion (FA) negative feedback to cell migration and invasion in melanoma. Our studies highlighted the top differentially expressed gene AKT1 and its correlation with the estrogen signaling and RAP1 signaling pathways to alter the proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells. Analysis of the enrichment functions of genes associated with melanoma will help us find the exact mechanism of melanoma and advance the full potential of newly targeted cancer therapy.<br><a

In addition, based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), we screened the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways which were enriched in the DEGs. For the DEGs with consistent differential expression in the two lists of DEGs, the LncRNA2Target database was used for the identification of long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA)‑gene pairs. A total of 218 and 591 DEGs were identified for the Hep3B‑C and Huh7‑C samples, respectively, and 22 overlaps were obtained. Biological processes and pathways related to steroid biosynthesis/metabolism or other substance transport were found to be enriched in the two lists of DEGs. Among the 22 overlaps, 16 were found to be consistently differentially expressed in the two HCSC samples, and the lncRNA‑gene regulatory network of these genes was constructed. Moreover, several potential biomarkers that may play important roles in the transformation of HCSCs were identified in the regulation network. Through the bioinformatics analysis of the RNA‑Seq dataset, several novel targets that were associated with the progression of HCC were obtained, and these targets may be valuable for the treatment and prognosis of HCC.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27797375/'>The novel G-quadruplex-containing long non-coding RNA GSEC antagonizes DHX36 and modulates colon cancer cell migration.</a>

followed by functional enrichment, protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network construction, key node and module analysis, and prediction of transcription factors (TFs) targeting genes in the significant modules. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles from 32 paired samples of carotid atheroma plaque tissue and macroscopically intact tissue were obtained, based on which 886 DEGs, including 513 upregulated genes and 373 downregulated genes, were identified. The upregulated and downregulated gene sets were enriched in 24 and 13 pathways, respectively. The PPI network constructed with these DEGs comprised 35 key nodes with degrees ≥20, among which spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), LYN and phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit γ (PIK3CG) were the three highest. A significant module was mined in the PPI network, which consisted of 29 DEGs targeted by 11 TFs. The DEGs between the carotid atheroma plaque and macroscopically intact tissue samples may be involved in carotid atherogenesis. Key nodes in the PPI network constructed from these DEGs and the genes involved in the significant module, including SYK, LYN and PIK3CG, are promising for the prediction of carotid plaque formation.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28259986/'>Identification of key genes and pathways associated with spinal cord injury.</a> March 6  2017<br><a
