Using hg19 annotation information provided by UCSC, liver cancer-related CNVs were then screened out. TF-target gene interactions were also predicted with information from UCSC using DAVID online tools. As a result, 25 CNV-driven genes were obtained, including tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) and RanBP-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger containing 1 (RBCK1). In the transcriptional regulatory network, 8 known cancer-related transcription factors (TFs) interacted with 21 CNV-driven genes, suggesting that the other 8 TFs may be involved in liver cancer. These genes may be potential biomarkers for early detection and prevention of liver cancer. These findings may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of liver cancer. Nevertheless, further experiments are still needed to confirm our findings.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26278982/'>Polyglucosan storage myopathies.</a> September 9  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27382069/'>HOXA1 binds RBCK1/HOIL-1 and TRAF2 and modulates the TNF/NF-κB pathway in a transcription-independent manner.</a> June 14  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27663060/'>What have we learned about glycogenosis in recent years?</a> September 25  2016<br></body></html>
