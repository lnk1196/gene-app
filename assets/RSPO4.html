Several evidences suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway is linked with memory and learning processes. In non-neuronal cells, the KIBRA protein is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (involved in the MAPK signaling) in cells as well as in vitro. Several of the other dysregulated genes are involved in memory and learning processes, as well as in Alzheimer's Disease. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of the WWC1 rs17070145 polymorphism on memory performance and Alzheimer's disease might be due to a differential regulation of the MAPK signaling, a key pathway involved in memory and learning processes.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28467820/'>Non-equivalence of Wnt and R-spondin ligands during Lgr5(+) intestinal stem-cell self-renewal.</a> May 4  2017<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504827/'>A Homozygous Missense Mutation in SLC25A16 is Associated with Autosomal Recessive Isolated Fingernail Dysplasia in a Pakistani Family.</a> May 16  2017<br></body></html>
