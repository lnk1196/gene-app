Question 13. A user has identified an interesting phenotype in a mouse model and has been able to narrow down the critical region for the responsible gene to approximately 0.5 cM. How does one find the mouse genes in this region?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578903/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 12. How does a user find characterized mouse mutants corresponding to human genes?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578902/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 11. An investigator has identified and cloned a human gene, but no corresponding mouse ortholog has yet been identified. How can a mouse genomic sequence with similarity to the human gene sequence be retrieved?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578899/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 8. How can one find all the members of a human gene family?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578898/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 7. How would an investigator easily find compiled information describing the structure of a gene of interest? Is it possible to obtain the sequence of any putative promoter regions?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578897/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 6. How would one retrieve the sequence of a gene, along with all annotated exons and introns, as well as a certain number of flanking bases for use in primer design?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578895/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 4. A user wishes to find all the single nucleotide polymorphisms that lie between two sequence-tagged sites. Do any of these single nucleotide polymorphisms fall within the coding region of a gene? Where can any additional information about the function of these genes be found?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578894/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 3. During a positional cloning project aimed at finding a human disease gene, linkage data have been obtained suggesting that the gene of interest lies between two sequence-tagged site markers. How can all the known and predicted candidate genes in this interval be identified? What BAC clones cover that particular region?</a> October 28  2003<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578892/'>A User's Guide to the Human Genome. Question 1. How does one find a gene of interest and determine that gene's structure? Once the gene has been located on the map, how does one easily examine other genes in that same region?</a> October 28  2003<br></body></html>
