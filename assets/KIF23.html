Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using pheatmap package of R language and KOBAS software, respectively. miRNAs related to up- and down-regulated DEGs were, respectively, predicted by WebGestalt software and its miRNAs-target DEGs interaction network were, respectively, constructed by STRING database. Bingo plug-in in Cytoscape software was applied to analyze Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis for up- and down-regulated DEGs in network, respectively. A total of 428 DEGs were selected, including 331 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated DEGs. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that glioma samples and normal samples were completely separated. Pathway analysis indicated that CDK2 and WEE1 participated in the cell cycle. miR-124 could simultaneously regulate up-regulated (ELAVL1 and EZH2) and down-regulated (BACE1) DEGs. The down-regulated genes (KIF23, WEE1 and CDK2) were associated with cell division, while the up-regulated genes (PLP1 and MBP) were related to myelination of neurons. miR-124 might participate in development of glioma by regulating BACE1, ELAVL1 and EZH2. The biomarkers (KIF23, WEE1, CDK2, PLP1 and MBP) were considered as therapeutic targets of glioma.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25348116/'>High prevalence of pfmdr1 N86Y and Y184F mutations in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.</a>  2014   &gt;1 were chosen as cut-off criterion.
