Among the 747 genes hypermethylated in radioresistant H1299 cells, CpG methylation of SERPINB5 and S100A6 in radioresistant H1299 cells was confirmed by methylation-specific PCR. Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed higher expression of these two genes in radiosensitive H460 cells compared with radioresistant H1299 cells. Downregulation of SERPINB5 or S100A6 by small interfering RNA in H460 cells increased the resistance of these cells to ionizing radiation. In contrast, promoter CpG sites of 344 genes, including CAT and BNC1, were hypomethylated in radioresistant H1299 cells. Suppression of CAT or BNC1 mRNA expression in H1299 cells also reduced the resistance of these cells to ionizing radiation. Thus, we identified DMGs by genome-wide CpG methylation profiling in two NSCLC cell lines with different responses to ionizing radiation, and our data indicated that these differences may be critical for epigenetic regulation of radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21741828/'>p63 Transcriptionally regulates BNC1, a Pol I and Pol II transcription factor that regulates ribosomal biogenesis and epithelial differentiation.</a> September 19  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23707421/'>HSF2BP represses BNC1 transcriptional activity by sequestering BNC1 to the cytoplasm.</a> September 6  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24454902/'>Tumor-specific hypermethylation of epigenetic biomarkers, including SFRP1, predicts for poorer survival in patients from the TCGA Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) project.</a> September 23  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26291085/'>Comprehensive DNA Methylation Analysis Reveals a Common Ten-Gene Methylation Signature in Colorectal Adenomas and Carcinomas.</a> May 12  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444083/'>Host Anti-antibody Responses Following Adeno-associated Virus-mediated Delivery of Antibodies Against HIV and SIV in Rhesus Monkeys.</a> October 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26821013/'>Decreased Expression of BNC1 and BNC2 Is Associated with Genetic or Epigenetic Regulation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a> November 12  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27698904/'>An Integrated Analysis of the Genome-Wide Profiles of DNA Methylation and mRNA Expression Defining the Side Population of a Human Malignant Mesothelioma Cell Line.</a> October 5  2016<br></body></html>
