Then Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses were performed for these DEGs in two groups, followed by the construction of weight PPI (protein-protein interaction) networks. Subnets enriched for the PPIs and differentially expressed genes were constructed based on the weight PPI networks. The overlapping genes between the genes in the top 10 subnets with smallest p value and the DEGs were selected as the candidate genes of disease. A total of 75 DEGs were identified in UC group and 87 ones in CD group. There were 69 and 57 specific DEGs in CD group and UC group, respectively. The DEGs in CD group were mainly enriched in &quot;inflammatory response&quot; and &quot;defense response&quot;, while the most significantly enriched GO terms in UC group were &quot;anion transport&quot; and &quot;chemotaxis&quot;. FOS and SOCS3 were identified as candidate genes for CD and other three genes HELB, ZBTB16 and FAM107A were candidate genes for UC. In conclusion, there were distinct genetic alterations between UC and CD. The candidate genes identified in current study may be used as biomarkers for differential diagnosis of CD and UC.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26774285/'>HELB Is a Feedback Inhibitor of DNA End Resection.</a> June 30  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27079536/'>Characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the human DNA helicase B (HELB) gene and its response to trans-Resveratrol.</a> March 10  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27079505/'>A Case of Beare-Stevenson Syndrome with Unusual Manifestations.</a> December 15  2016<br></body></html>
