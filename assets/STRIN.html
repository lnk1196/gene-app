2014  &gt;2) with packages in R language. The selected DEGs were further analyzed with bioinformatic methods. After an interaction network of DEGs was constructed by STRING, we selected the most important hub gene through network topological analysis (including node degree, clustering coefficient and path length) and analyzed functions and pathways of the hub gene network. A total of 538 genes were filtered as DEGs between normal and disease samples, and we selected the gene TSPO as the most important hub gene. Among its interactors, the CTSK gene and the IL8 gene participated in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway which is closely related to tumor occurrence. The TSPO gene and its interactors may affect the cancer-specific gene expression by participating in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Our discovery may be useful in investigating the complex interacting mechanisms underlying the disease. However, further experiments are still needed to confirm our result.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24500524/'>An integration-defective lentivirus-based resource for site-specific targeting of an edited safe-harbour locus in the human genome.</a> December 15  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24520073/'>MALDI-MSI and label-free LC-ESI-MS/MS shotgun proteomics to investigate protein induction in a murine fibrosarcoma model following treatment with a vascular disrupting agent.</a> December 15  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24573512/'>RASSF1A promotes apoptosis and suppresses the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.</a> December 15  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24599781/'>Immune-related chemotactic factors were found in acute coronary syndromes by bioinformatics.</a> February 3  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24615040/'>Screening of key genes of unruptured intracranial aneurysms by using DNA microarray data analysis techniques.</a> November 5  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24672526/'>Definition of a Family of Tissue-Protective Cytokines Using Functional Cluster Analysis: A Proof-of-Concept Study.</a> March 29  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24715111/'>Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed proteins in denervated skeletal muscle.</a> December 19  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24718460/'>Identification of thyroid carcinoma related genes with mRMR and shortest path approaches.</a> June 17  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24728565/'>Uncovering the pathogenesis and identifying novel targets of pancreatic cancer using bioinformatics approach.</a> February 3  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24736319/'>Network analysis of inflammatory genes and their transcriptional regulators in coronary artery disease.</a> January 16  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24771407/'>Bioinformatics approach to evaluate differential gene expression of M1/M2 macrophage phenotypes and antioxidant genes in atherosclerosis.</a> July 3  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24789420/'>Identification of the typical miRNAs and target genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a> January 15  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24830558/'>The G protein-coupled receptor heterodimer network (GPCR-HetNet) and its hub components.</a> January 7  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24838153/'>Bioinformatics analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children with type 1 diabetes in 3 periods.</a>  2014  &gt;0.58 and P-value&lt;0.05.

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for the DEGs using STRING, and sub-networks were analyzed by Clustering with Overlapping Neighborhood Expansion. A total of 556 DEGs were identified in the cisplatin-sensitive OC cells, of which 246 were upregulated and 310 were downregulated. Functional enrichment analysis revealed metabolism-associated pathways, DNA replication and cell cycle were significantly enriched in the downregulated genes, while cell growth and differentiation, response to stimulus, and apoptosis were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes. A PPI network, including 342 nodes was constructed for the DEGs and four subnetworks were extracted from the entire network. A total of 34 DEGs interacting with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) were identified, which were associated with DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism and cell cycle. In conclusion, a number of key genes and pathways associated with the cisplatin-resistance of OC were revealed, particularly EZH2. These findings assist in the development of therapy for OC.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25966254/'>Bioinformatic analysis of the effect of type II diabetes on skin wound healing.</a>

The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed based on the online server STRING (criterion: combined score &gt; 0.4). Next, miRNAs that targeted DEGs were predicted based on Webgestalt (criteria: P &lt; 0.05 and target DEGs ≥ 2), and miRNA-DEG regulatory networks were visualized through Cytoscape.A total of 179 DEGs were identified. Next, 5 functions and 1 pathway were enriched by up-regulated DEGs, while 4 functions were enriched by down-regulated DEGs. Furthermore, miRNA-DEG regulatory networks were constructed. IL1B was the hub-gene of PPI networks, and AUTS2 and KIAA2022 were predicted to be targeted by miR-518a, miR518e, miR-518f, miR-528a, and miR-96.IL1B, IL12RB2, AUTS2, and KIAA2022 might participate in AVSD in DS patients, and AUTS2 and KIAA2022 might be targeted by miR-518a, miR-518e, miR-518f, miR-528a, and miR-96.

After constructing the gene interaction network by STRING with the selected DEGs, we applied a statistical approach to identify the topological hub genes with PageRank score. Forty-four genes were identified in this network and AKT1 was selected as the most important hub gene. The AKT1 gene encodes a serine‑threonine protein kinase (AKT). High expression of AKT is involved in the resistance of cell apoptosis as well as adaptive resistance to treatment in melanoma. Our results indicated that AKT1 with a higher expression in melanoma showed enriched binding sites in the negative regulation of response to external stimulus, which enables cells to adapt to changes in external stimulation for survival. Another finding was that AKT regulated the lipid metabolic process and may be involved in melanoma progression and promotion of tumor growth through gene enrichment function analysis. Two highlighted pathways were detected in our study: i) the estrogen signaling pathway modulates the immune tolerance and resistance to cell apoptosis, which contributes to the growth of melanoma and ii) the RAP1 signaling pathway which regulates focal adhesion (FA) negative feedback to cell migration and invasion in melanoma. Our studies highlighted the top differentially expressed gene AKT1 and its correlation with the estrogen signaling and RAP1 signaling pathways to alter the proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells. Analysis of the enrichment functions of genes associated with melanoma will help us find the exact mechanism of melanoma and advance the full potential of newly targeted cancer therapy.<br><a
