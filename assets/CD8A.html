Furthermore, interaction network and sub-network of these of these DEGs were constructed by NetBox. Linker genes were screened in the Global Network database. The degree of linker genes were calculated by igraph package in R language. Gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed for DEGs and network modules. A total of 246 DEGs were identified in MI, which were enriched in the immune response. In the interaction network, LCK, CD247, CD3D, FYN, HLA-DRA, IL2, CD8A CD3E, CD4, CD3G had high degree, among which CD3E, CD4, CD3G were DEGs while others were linker genes screened from Global Network database. Genes in the sub-network were also enriched in the immune response pathway. The genes with high degree may be biomarkers for MI diagnosis and therapy.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24782321/'>Neo-antigens predicted by tumor genome meta-analysis correlate with increased patient survival.</a> December 30  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25197660/'>Alzheimer's disease and HLA-A2: linking neurodegenerative to immune processes through an in silico approach.</a> June 30  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25690570/'>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CD8A and their associations with T lymphocyte subpopulations in pig.</a> October 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25774455/'>Expression patterns of immune-associated genes in external genital and perianal warts treated with sinecatechins.</a> January 28  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25944698/'>Differential gene expression in human abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic occlusive disease.</a> April 14  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26148331/'>The expression of B &amp; T cell activation markers in children's tonsils following live attenuated influenza vaccine.</a> May 10  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26148245/'>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a potential consequence of tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor therapy.</a> June 3  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26448945/'>Overexpression of GPC6 and TMEM132D in Early Stage Ovarian Cancer Correlates with CD8+ T-Lymphocyte Infiltration and Increased Patient Survival.</a> July 20  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26871709/'>The Impact of HIV Co-Infection on the Genomic Response to Sepsis.</a> July 28  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26871478/'>Mutanome and expression of immune response genes in microsatellite stable colon cancer.</a> February 12  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26980598/'>Neoantigen Load, Antigen Presentation Machinery, and Immune Signatures Determine Prognosis in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.</a> January 25  2016<br></body></html>
