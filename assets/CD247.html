Furthermore, interaction network and sub-network of these of these DEGs were constructed by NetBox. Linker genes were screened in the Global Network database. The degree of linker genes were calculated by igraph package in R language. Gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed for DEGs and network modules. A total of 246 DEGs were identified in MI, which were enriched in the immune response. In the interaction network, LCK, CD247, CD3D, FYN, HLA-DRA, IL2, CD8A CD3E, CD4, CD3G had high degree, among which CD3E, CD4, CD3G were DEGs while others were linker genes screened from Global Network database. Genes in the sub-network were also enriched in the immune response pathway. The genes with high degree may be biomarkers for MI diagnosis and therapy.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24797614/'>Spatially conserved regulatory elements identified within human and mouse Cd247 gene using high-throughput sequencing data from the ENCODE project.</a> August 29  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24797605/'>A novel variant in the 3' untranslated region of the CDK4 gene: interference with microRNA target sites and role in increased risk of cutaneous melanoma.</a> August 16  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25569266/'>Genetic association of CD247 (CD3ζ) with SLE in a large-scale multiethnic study.</a> January 5  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25643737/'>Influence of orally administered Lactobacillus GG on respiratory immune response in a murine model of diet-induced obesity.</a> November 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25643705/'>BRCA1 Circos: a visualisation resource for functional analysis of missense variants.</a> December 22  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25643699/'>Cep63 recruits cdk1 to the centrosome-letter.</a> April 14  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25732729/'>A novel thymoma-associated immunodeficiency with increased naive T cells and reduced CD247 expression.</a> June 9  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26207425/'>Brief Exercises Affect Gene Expression in Circulating Monocytes.</a> January 30  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432898/'>Response to Comment on &quot;A Novel Thymoma-Associated Immunodeficiency with Increased Naive T Cells and Reduced CD247 Expression&quot;.</a> December 29  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432897/'>Comment on &quot;A Novel Thymoma-Associated Immunodeficiency with Increased Naive T Cells and Reduced CD247 Expression&quot;.</a> December 29  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26542031/'>Natural killer cell hyporesponsiveness and impaired development in a CD247-deficient patient.</a> August 9  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26786204/'>CNS-wide Sexually Dimorphic Induction of the Major Histocompatibility Complex 1 Pathway With Aging.</a> January 21  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27716086/'>Association of CD247 (CD3ζ) gene polymorphisms with T1D and AITD in the population of northern Sweden.</a> May 4  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27984087/'>Genomic and genetic studies of systemic sclerosis: A systematic review.</a> December 17  2016<br></body></html>
