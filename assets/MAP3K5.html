Functional annotation indicated that these genes are involved in cellular processes relevant to the cancer phenotype, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair, proteolysis, protease inhibition, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Six of the identified transcripts map to intronic regions of protein-coding genes and may comprise non-annotated exons or as yet uncharacterized long ncRNAs with a regulatory role in the gene expression program of larynx tissue. The differential expression of 10 of these genes (ADCY6, AES, AL2SCR3, CRR9, CSTB, DUSP1, MAP3K5, PLAT, UBL1 and ZNF706) was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Among these, the CSTB gene product has cysteine protease inhibitor activity that has been associated with an antimetastatic function. Interestingly, CSTB showed a low expression in the tumor samples analyzed (p&lt;0.0001). The set of genes identified here contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of larynx cancer, and provide candidate markers for improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this carcinoma.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20035634/'>Differential expression of apoptotic genes PDIA3 and MAP3K5 distinguishes between low- and high-risk prostate cancer.</a> April 30  2009<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20143136/'>A 'metastasis-prone' signature for early-stage mismatch-repair proficient sporadic colorectal cancer patients and its implications for possible therapeutics.</a> March 26  2010<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21107515/'>Cell cloning-based transcriptome analysis in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 mutation patients with severe epileptic encephalopathy.</a> December 17  2010<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21117066/'>Evaluation of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas by high-resolution oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization.</a> March 16  2010<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21764682/'>[Relationship between MAP3K5 and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded miR-BART22 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma].</a> April 17  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22387046/'>Searching for molecular targets in sarcoma.</a> July 10  2012<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23422081/'>Autophagy and ER stress play an essential role in the mechanism of action and drug resistance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol.</a> September 24  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23556445/'>Genomic variation in the MAP3K5 gene is associated with Î²-thalassemia disease severity and hydroxyurea treatment efficacy.</a> September 24  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24008424/'>Somatic mutations in MAP3K5 attenuate its proapoptotic function in melanoma through increased binding to thioredoxin.</a> March 26  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24008420/'>OntoQuery: easy-to-use web-based OWL querying.</a> May 8  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24448648/'>Roquin-2 promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ASK1 to regulate stress responses.</a> September 23  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25848766/'>Genomic heterogeneity of osteosarcoma - shift from single candidates to functional modules.</a> January 5  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25848765/'>High expression of KCa3.1 in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma predicts high metastatic risk and poor survival.</a> March 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165383/'>Genetic variation in the TNF/TRAF2/ASK1/p38 kinase signaling pathway as markers for postoperative pulmonary complications in lung cancer patients.</a> July 29  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27525933/'>Porcine MAP3K5 analysis: molecular cloning, characterization, tissue expression pattern, and copy number variations associated with residual feed intake.</a> February 25  2016<br></body></html>
