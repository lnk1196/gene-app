Several genes which responded with high expression levels (&gt;2 fold) included KIF20A, NEFM, C7orf10, HIST1H2BD, BMP6, and HIST1H2AC. Among the high expressing genes, five (CCNB2, BUB1, NEK2, CDC20, AURKA) were also differentially expressed at the medium (1.0 Gy) dose however, these genes were unmodulated following exposure to X-irradiation. Networks of these genes clustered around tumor protein-53 and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. This study has identified some potential gene /protein responses and networks that may be validated further to confirm their specificity and potential to be signature biomarkers of Î±-particle exposure.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793025/'>Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies new susceptibility loci for migraine.</a> October 18  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792903/'>Chlamydia trachomatis is present and metabolically active during the remitting phase in synovial tissues from patients with chronic Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis.</a> August 30  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23893049/'>C7orf10 encodes succinate-hydroxymethylglutarate CoA-transferase, the enzyme that converts glutarate to glutaryl-CoA.</a> September 10  2013<br></body></html>
