Coexpression between genes was examined with String, and a network was then constructed. Relevant pathways and diseases were retrieved with KOBAS. A total of 56 DEGs were obtained in the IDC of the breast compared with normal controls. A gene coexpression network including 27 pairs of genes was constructed and all the genes in the network were upregulated. Further study indicated that most of the genes in the coexpression network were enriched in ECM-receptor interaction (COL4A2, FN1, and HMMR) and nucleotide excision repair (CETN2 and PCNA) pathways, and that the most significantly related disease was autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes. A number of DEGs were acquired through comparative analysis of gene expression data. These findings are beneficial in promoting the understanding of the molecular mechanisms in breast cancer. More importantly, some key genes were revealed via gene coexpression network analysis, which could be potential biomarkers for IDC of the breast.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25830658/'>Assessing associations between the AURKA-HMMR-TPX2-TUBG1 functional module and breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.</a> December 23  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26295306/'>Combined expressional analysis, bioinformatics and targeted proteomics identify new potential therapeutic targets in glioblastoma stem cells.</a> July 23  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27840977/'>Expression of genes encoding centrosomal proteins and the humoral response against these proteins in chronic myeloid leukemia.</a> November 15  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27932211/'>A novel class of somatic mutations in blood detected preferentially in CD8+ cells.</a> December 10  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27932171/'>Recurrence of Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 2 Phenotype After Living-donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.</a> April 27  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28196904/'>Extracellular Matrix Receptor Expression in Subtypes of Lung Adenocarcinoma Potentiates Outgrowth of Micrometastases.</a> February 16  2017<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28217782/'>Receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM/HMMR) is a novel target for promoting subcutaneous adipogenesis.</a> February 21  2017<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28595038/'>Bio-electric field enhancement: the influence on hyaluronan mediated motility receptors in human breast carcinoma.</a> June 9  2017<br></body></html>
