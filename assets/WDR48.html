From the 101 SNPs successfully genotyped, 99 SNPs were nominally associated with IA. Replication of technically validated SNPs was conducted in an independent replication dataset (100 Portuguese IA cases and 407 controls). rs4667622 (between UBR3 and MYO3B), rs6599001 (between SCN11A and WDR48), rs3932338 (214 kilobases downstream of PRDM9), and rs10943471 (96 kilobases upstream of HTR1B) were associated with IA (unadjusted allelic chi-square tests) in the datasets tested (discovery: 6.84E-04≤P≤1.92E-02, replication: 2.66E-04≤P≤2.28E-02, and combined datasets: 6.05E-05≤P≤5.50E-04). Additionally, we confirmed the known association with IA of rs1333040 at the 9p21.3 genomic region, thus validating our dataset. These novel findings in the Portuguese population warrant further replication in additional independent studies, and provide additional candidates to more comprehensively understand IA etiopathogenesis.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26388029/'>Structural Insights into WD-Repeat 48 Activation of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 46.</a> August 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28302046/'>The role of the complex USP1/WDR48 in differentiation and proliferation processes in cancer stem cells.</a> March 18  2017<br></body></html>
