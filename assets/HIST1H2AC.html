Several genes which responded with high expression levels (&gt;2 fold) included KIF20A, NEFM, C7orf10, HIST1H2BD, BMP6, and HIST1H2AC. Among the high expressing genes, five (CCNB2, BUB1, NEK2, CDC20, AURKA) were also differentially expressed at the medium (1.0 Gy) dose however, these genes were unmodulated following exposure to X-irradiation. Networks of these genes clustered around tumor protein-53 and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. This study has identified some potential gene /protein responses and networks that may be validated further to confirm their specificity and potential to be signature biomarkers of Î±-particle exposure.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23717473/'>A subset of histone H2B genes produces polyadenylated mRNAs under a variety of cellular conditions.</a> April 18  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23717463/'>1(OH) vitamin D3 supplementation improves the sensitivity of the immune-response during Peg-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients-case controlled trial.</a> January 8  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23956221/'>Increasing the complexity of chromatin: functionally distinct roles for replication-dependent histone H2A isoforms in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.</a> January 8  2013<br></body></html>
