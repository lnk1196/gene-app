(-3279T&gt;G, 0.55), but weakly associated with UGT1A1*28 (-54_-39A(TA)(6)TAA&gt;A(TA)(7)TAA, 0.25). Haplotype analysis showed that 98% of the I399C alleles were linked with low-activity haplotypes, either UGT1A1*6, *28, or *60. On the other hand, 85% of the T alleles were linked with the UGT1A1 wild-type haplotype *1. Although I399T-dependent increases in SN-38 glucuronide/SN-38 area under concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio (an in vivo marker for UGT1A activity) and decreases in SN-38 AUC/dose were apparent (P &lt; 0.0001), these effects were no longer observed after stratified patients by UGT1A1*6, *28, or *60 haplotype. Thus, at least in Japanese populations, influence of I399C&gt;T on SN-38 glucuronidation is attributable to its close association with either UGT1A1*6, *28, or *60.<br><a
