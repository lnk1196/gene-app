The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed based on the online server STRING (criterion: combined score &gt; 0.4). Next, miRNAs that targeted DEGs were predicted based on Webgestalt (criteria: P &lt; 0.05 and target DEGs ≥ 2), and miRNA-DEG regulatory networks were visualized through Cytoscape.A total of 179 DEGs were identified. Next, 5 functions and 1 pathway were enriched by up-regulated DEGs, while 4 functions were enriched by down-regulated DEGs. Furthermore, miRNA-DEG regulatory networks were constructed. IL1B was the hub-gene of PPI networks, and AUTS2 and KIAA2022 were predicted to be targeted by miR-518a, miR518e, miR-518f, miR-528a, and miR-96.IL1B, IL12RB2, AUTS2, and KIAA2022 might participate in AVSD in DS patients, and AUTS2 and KIAA2022 might be targeted by miR-518a, miR-518e, miR-518f, miR-528a, and miR-96. The identified genes and miRNAs might provide a theoretical basis for understanding AVSD in DS patients.<br></body></html>
