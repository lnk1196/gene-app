In total, 4556, 1806, 3406 and 8623 genes were regulated by echimidine, heliotrine, senecione and senkirkine, respectively. 1304 genes were identified as commonly regulated. PA affected pathways related to cell cycle regulation, cell death and cancer development. The transcription factors TP53, MYC, NFκB and NUPR1 were predicted to be activated upon PA treatment. Furthermore, gene expression data showed a considerable interference with lipid metabolism and bile acid flow. The associated transcription factors FXR, LXR, SREBF1/2, and PPARα/γ/δ were predicted to be inhibited. In conclusion, though structurally different, all four PA significantly regulated a great number of genes in common. This proposes similar molecular mechanisms, although the extent seems to differ between the analyzed PA as reflected by the potential hepatotoxicity and individual PA structure.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26173068/'>Identification of a mitochondrial defect gene signature reveals NUPR1 as a key regulator of liver cancer progression.</a> January 20  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350749/'>Mitochondrial defect-responsive gene signature in liver-cancer progression.</a> August 6  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26392315/'>Hepatitis B virus X promotes hepatocellular carcinoma development via nuclear protein 1 pathway.</a> April 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26865111/'>Temporal retinal transcriptome and systems biology analysis identifies key pathways and hub genes in Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis.</a> December 17  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27336713/'>NUPR1, a new target in liver cancer: implication in controlling cell growth, migration, invasion and sorafenib resistance.</a> June 24  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177777/'>High concentration calcitriol induces endoplasmic reticulum stress related gene profile in breast cancer cells.</a> February 9  2017<br></body></html>
