Furthermore, interaction network and sub-network of these of these DEGs were constructed by NetBox. Linker genes were screened in the Global Network database. The degree of linker genes were calculated by igraph package in R language. Gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed for DEGs and network modules. A total of 246 DEGs were identified in MI, which were enriched in the immune response. In the interaction network, LCK, CD247, CD3D, FYN, HLA-DRA, IL2, CD8A CD3E, CD4, CD3G had high degree, among which CD3E, CD4, CD3G were DEGs while others were linker genes screened from Global Network database. Genes in the sub-network were also enriched in the immune response pathway. The genes with high degree may be biomarkers for MI diagnosis and therapy.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25946140/'>Differentially expressed gene transcripts using RNA sequencing from the blood of immunosuppressed kidney allograft recipients.</a> April 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174627/'>Aberrant DNA methylation impacts gene expression and prognosis in breast cancer subtypes.</a> February 10  2015<br></body></html>
