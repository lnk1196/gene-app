II. Induction of necrosis in skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes and modulation of levels of Bcl-2 family members.</a>  2001  2001), no apoptosis was observed. At higher levels (&gt;200 microg/ml; 2.5 x 10(-4) dilution), JP-8 is cytotoxic to both primary and immortalized human keratinocytes, as evidenced by the metabolism of calcein, as well as by morphological changes such as cell rounding and cell detachment. There was no evidence of activation of caspases-3, -7, or -8 either by enzyme activity or immunoblot analysis, and the stable expression of a dominant-negative inhibitor of apoptosis (FADD-DN) did not increase the survival of keratinocytes to JP-8. The pattern of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was also characteristic of necrosis. PARP has been also been implicated in necrosis via its ability to lower levels of ATP in damaged cells. However, fibroblasts derived from PARP-/- mice underwent necrotic cell death similar to those derived from PARP+/+ mice, indicating that the effects of JP-8 are independent of PARP. Immunoblot analysis further revealed that exposure of keratinocytes to the toxic higher levels of JP-8 markedly downregulates the expression of the prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), and upregulates the expression of antisurvival members of this family, including Bad and Bak. Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) have been shown to preserve mitochondrial integrity and suppress cell death. In contrast, Bak and Bad both promote cell death by alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential, in part by heterodimerization with and inactivation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), and either inducing necrosis or activating a downstream caspase program. High intrinsic levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) may prevent apoptotic death of keratinocytes at lower levels of JP-8, while perturbation of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members at higher levels may ultimately play a role in necrotic cell death in human keratinocytes. Finally, when human keratinocytes were grafted to form a human epidermis on nude mice, treatment of these grafts with JP-8 revealed cytotoxicity and altered histology in vivo.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11231290/'>Structure-activity relationship of the p55 TNF receptor death domain and its lymphoproliferation mutants.</a> March 7  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11259186/'>Molluscum contagiosum virus inhibitors of apoptosis: The MC159 v-FLIP protein blocks Fas-induced activation of procaspases and degradation of the related MC160 protein.</a> March 22  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11259172/'>Identification and characterization of a novel mutation c.1090G&gt;T (G325W) and nine common mutant alleles leading to Gaucher disease in Spanish patients.</a> March 22  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11262395/'>Bcl-rambo, a novel Bcl-2 homologue that induces apoptosis via its unique C-terminal extension.</a> March 23  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11314043/'>Cell type specific involvement of death receptor and mitochondrial pathways in drug-induced apoptosis.</a> April 21  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11313933/'>Activation of the Fas pathway independently of Fas ligand during apoptosis induced by camptothecin in p53 mutant human colon carcinoma cells.</a> April 21  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11321232/'>The Fas signaling connection between autoimmunity and embryonic lethality.</a> April 26  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11336543/'>Hepatitis C virus core protein enhances FADD-mediated apoptosis and suppresses TRADD signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor.</a> May 5  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11360196/'>Intracellular mechanisms of TRAIL: apoptosis through mitochondrial-dependent and -independent pathways.</a> May 22  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11384965/'>Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8 mediate up-regulation of c-Fos by Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) via a FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP)-regulated pathway.</a> June 1  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11413052/'>Apoptosis of smooth muscle cells is not silent: Fas/FADD initiates a program of inflammatory gene expression.</a> June 20  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11420694/'>Transcriptional activation of TRADD mediates p53-independent radiation-induced apoptosis of glioma cells.</a> June 23  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11468180/'>Altered apoptosis pathways in mantle cell lymphoma detected by oligonucleotide microarray.</a>  7  Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, 8700 Beverly Road, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. w.k.hofmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de,<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11497281/'>FADD gene therapy using the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) gene promoter to restrict induction of apoptosis to tumors in vitro and in vivo.</a> August 11  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11497280/'>Clinical significance of the Rb expression in adenocarcinoma of the lung.</a> August 11  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11507096/'>The bile acid glycochenodeoxycholate induces trail-receptor 2/DR5 expression and apoptosis.</a> August 17  2001<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11600497/'>Non-apoptotic signaling pathways activated by soluble Fas ligand in serum-starved human fibroblasts.
