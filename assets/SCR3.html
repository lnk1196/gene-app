Functional annotation indicated that these genes are involved in cellular processes relevant to the cancer phenotype, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair, proteolysis, protease inhibition, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Six of the identified transcripts map to intronic regions of protein-coding genes and may comprise non-annotated exons or as yet uncharacterized long ncRNAs with a regulatory role in the gene expression program of larynx tissue. The differential expression of 10 of these genes (ADCY6, AES, AL2SCR3, CRR9, CSTB, DUSP1, MAP3K5, PLAT, UBL1 and ZNF706) was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Among these, the CSTB gene product has cysteine protease inhibitor activity that has been associated with an antimetastatic function. Interestingly, CSTB showed a low expression in the tumor samples analyzed (p&lt;0.0001). The set of genes identified here contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of larynx cancer, and provide candidate markers for improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this carcinoma.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21375663/'>Dissemination of IncFII plasmids carrying rmtB and qepA in Escherichia coli from pigs, farm workers and the environment.</a> February 9  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21786200/'>Structure and function of ALG-2, a penta-EF-hand calcium-dependent adaptor protein.</a> November 16  2011<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22225906/'>Evidence that GTP-binding domain but not catalytic domain of transglutaminase 2 is essential for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells.</a> February 8  2012<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23350699/'>ALG-2-interacting Tubby-like protein superfamily member PLSCR3 is secreted by an exosomal pathway and taken up by recipient cultured cells.</a> September 5  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24511017/'>Activation of YAP1 is associated with poor prognosis and response to taxanes in ovarian cancer.</a> March 29  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25269617/'>Evaluation and validation of the suitable control genes for quantitative PCR studies in plasma DNA for nonâ€‘invasive prenatal diagnosis.</a> July 22  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26677203/'>Tubby-like protein superfamily member PLSCR3 functions as a negative regulator of adipogenesis in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by suppressing induction of late differentiation stage transcription factors.</a> October 16  2015<br></body></html>
