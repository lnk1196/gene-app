The cluster analysis of these DEGs showed that 4 genes, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DQA1), HLA-DRB4, integrin 3 (ITGB3) and killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily F member 1 (KLRF1) were all significantly expressed in 3 groups, which were significantly enriched in asthma, T1D and intestinal immune network for IgA production pathway. And 57 genes enriched in cluster 5, which were only differentially expressed in NEW group, were involved in response to wounding, inflammatory response and blood coagulation as well as chemokine signaling pathway. Besides, the hub genes in PPI network of cluster 5 were identified, containing FOS, pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), interleukin 8 (IL8), formyl peptide receptor-like 2 (FPR2) and platelet factor 4 (PF4).HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB4, ITGB3 and KLRF1 might be targets for treatment of T1D, and 5 hub proteins, FOS, PPBP, IL8, FPR2 and PF4, were likely to be new markers for diagnosis of T1D.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26367242/'>Characterization of the platelet transcriptome by RNA sequencing in patients with acute myocardial infarction.</a> December 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27084257/'>Inhibition of human primary megakaryocyte differentiation by anagrelide: a gene expression profiling analysis.</a> March 10  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27084251/'>JAK2V617F allele burden in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms carrying Trisomy 9, and its relationship with clinical phenotypes.</a> January 10  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812736/'>Integrative analysis for identification of shared markers from various functional cells/tissues for rheumatoid arthritis.</a> November 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812689/'>Association of Polymorphisms in FCGR2A and FCGR3A With Degree of Trastuzumab Benefit in the Adjuvant Treatment of ERBB2/HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: Analysis of the NSABP B-31 Trial.</a> November 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812659/'>Prevalence, and virulence determination of Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from clinical and non-clinical samples by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.</a> November 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812655/'>Genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis spp. in road-killed wild mammals from the Central Western Region of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</a> November 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812618/'>Interaction of dental pulp stem cells with Biodentine and MTA after exposure to different environments.</a> November 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28467728/'>The PF4/PPBP/CXCL5 Gene Cluster Is Associated with Periodontitis.</a> May 4  2017<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28467721/'>Reactive Oxygen Species Regulate Both Priming and Established Arthritis, but with Different Mechanisms.</a> May 4  2017<br></body></html>
