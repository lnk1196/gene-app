pancreatic cancer samples and normal controls. Transcription factors (TFs) were selected from the DEGs based on TRASFAC database. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (p value &lt;0.05), followed by construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes software. Latent pathway identification analysis was applied to analyze the DEGs-related pathways crosstalk and the pathways with high weight value were included in the pathway crosstalk network using Cytoscape. Sixty-five DEGs were screened out. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD), FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene B (FOSB), Stratifin (SFN), KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3 (NR4A3) were important TFs. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was the hub node of the PPI network. DEGs were significantly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway which was primarily interacted with inflammation and immune related pathways (cytosolic DNA-sensing, hematopoietic cell lineage, intestinal immune network for IgA production and chemokine pathways). The study suggested CEBPD, FOSB, SFN, KLF5, PTX3, NR4A3, IL-6, and NOD-like receptor pathways were involved in pancreatic cancer.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434468/'>Analysis of the protein-protein interaction networks of differentially expressed genes in pulmonary embolism.</a> September 17  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25468726/'>Molecular mechanisms of osteoarthritis using gene microarrays.</a>  2014  &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were screened as DEGs (differentially expressed genes). The screened DEGs were then subject to functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID (Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery). Next, gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichment map Cytoscape plug-in, followed by detecting sub-networks using clusterONE. Finally, risk subpathways were screened using iSubpathwayMiner package. A total of 141 DEGs were screened, including 52 up-regulated ones and 89 down-regulated ones. These DEGs were enriched in 48 GO terms that were mainly related to locomotory behavior, taxis, adhesion, and 11 pathways that were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, as well as several signaling pathways. The enrichment map enriched gene-sets mainly related to cell death and apoptosis, and extracellular components. The risk pathways up-regulated DEGs were exclusively related to arachidonic acid metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and the top two risk pathways were tyrosine metabolism for the down-regulated ones. From this study we conclude that genes involved in cell death and apoptosis, as well as cell-extracellular matrix interaction, may be essential for OA pathogenesis by altering multiple signaling pathways.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25468715/'>Clinical impact of herpesvirus entry mediator expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a>  2014  &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were screened as DEGs (differentially expressed genes).

The DEGs were further analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Firstly, DEGs were subject to a hierarchical cluster analysis. Subsequently, the functional enrichment analysis was performed for the common DEGs between the two time periods. Finally, the transcription factors and binding sites of DEGs associated with response to GC stimulus were analyzed. A total of 696 and 949 DEGs were identified atÂ 4Â h and 16Â h, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that DEG expression was higher in the Dex group than in the control group (P&lt;0.05). A total ofÂ 13 significant functions were enriched for the 72 common DEGs at the two time periods. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligandÂ 2 (CCL2), dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1) and FAS were associated with the response to GC stimulus and the transcription factor câJun bound to promoter regulation regions of CCL2, DUSP1 and FAS. In conclusion, the transcription factors and binding sites of DEGs associated with the response of LECs to GCs may provide potential gene targets for designing and developing drugs to protect against GC-induced cataract formation.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680412/'>Crucial microRNAs and genes of human primary breast cancer explored by microRNA-mRNA integrated analysis.</a> October 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25721208/'>Identification of crucial genes in intracranial aneurysm based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis.</a> March 5  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25777263/'>Screening Feature Genes of Venous Thromboembolism with DNA Microarray.</a> July 21  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824797/'>Analysis of molecular pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with a bioinformatics approach.</a> February 2  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824796/'>Effects of TESTIN gene expression on proliferation and migration of the 5-8F nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line.</a> February 2  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25824785/'>Loss of heterozygosity at the calcium regulation gene locus on chromosome 10q in human pancreatic cancer.</a> February 2  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25918880/'>Revealing the underlying mechanism of diabetic nephropathy viewed by microarray analysis.</a> March 11  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25918870/'>MR elastography for evaluating regeneration of tissue-engineered cartilage in an ectopic mouse model.</a> December 15  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25955318/'>Involvement of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer cells by interacting with several genes.</a>  2015  &gt;1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis were performed on the DEGs using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for the DEGs using STRING, and sub-networks were analyzed by Clustering with Overlapping Neighborhood Expansion. A total of 556 DEGs were identified in the cisplatin-sensitive OC cells, of which 246 were upregulated and 310 were downregulated. Functional enrichment analysis revealed metabolism-associated pathways, DNA replication and cell cycle were significantly enriched in the downregulated genes, while cell growth and differentiation, response to stimulus, and apoptosis were significantly enriched in the upregulated genes. A PPI network, including 342 nodes was constructed for the DEGs and four subnetworks were extracted from the entire network. A total of 34 DEGs interacting with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) were identified, which were associated with DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism and cell cycle. In conclusion, a number of key genes and pathways associated with the cisplatin-resistance of OC were revealed, particularly EZH2.
