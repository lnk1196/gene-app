Then, differentially co-expressed genes (DCGs) and differentially co-expressed links (DCLs) were screened with q&lt;0.25 by the differential coexpression analysis and differential regulation analysis of gene expression microarray data package. Secondly, pathway enrichment analysis for DCGs was performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the DCLs associated with RA were selected by comparing the obtained DCLs with known transcription factor (TF)-targets in the TRANSFAC database. Finally, the obtained TFs were mapped to the known TF-targets to construct the network using cytoscape software. A total of 1755 DEGs, 457 DCGs and 101988 DCLs were achieved and there were 20 TFs in the obtained six TF-target relations (STAT3-TNF, PBX1‑PLAU, SOCS3-STAT3, GATA1-ETS2, ETS1-ICAM4 and CEBPE‑GATA1) and 457 DCGs. A number of TF-target relations in the constructed network were not within DCLs when the TF and target gene were DCGs. The identified TFs may have an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for RA.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25175491/'>A three-gene panel that distinguishes benign from malignant thyroid nodules.</a> April 22  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25335079/'>Integrated exon level expression analysis of driver genes explain their role in colorectal cancer.</a> June 27  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25370074/'>Screening of human chromosome 21 genes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with Down syndrome.</a>  2014  &gt;1. The expression levels of these genes in the two samples were different. In addition, the up‑ and downregulated genes were markedly enriched in organic substance biological processes (P=4.48x10‑10) and cell‑cell signaling (P=0.000227). Furthermore, 17 overexpressed genes were identified on the 21q21‑22 area, including COL6A2, TTC3 and ABCG1. Together, these observations suggest that 17 upregulated genes on HC21 may be involved in the development of DS and provide the basis for understanding this disability.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25468726/'>Molecular mechanisms of osteoarthritis using gene microarrays.</a>  2014  &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were screened as DEGs (differentially expressed genes). The screened DEGs were then subject to functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID (Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery). Next, gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichment map Cytoscape plug-in, followed by detecting sub-networks using clusterONE. Finally, risk subpathways were screened using iSubpathwayMiner package. A total of 141 DEGs were screened, including 52 up-regulated ones and 89 down-regulated ones. These DEGs were enriched in 48 GO terms that were mainly related to locomotory behavior, taxis, adhesion, and 11 pathways that were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, as well as several signaling pathways. The enrichment map enriched gene-sets mainly related to cell death and apoptosis, and extracellular components. The risk pathways up-regulated DEGs were exclusively related to arachidonic acid metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and the top two risk pathways were tyrosine metabolism for the down-regulated ones. From this study we conclude that genes involved in cell death and apoptosis, as well as cell-extracellular matrix interaction, may be essential for OA pathogenesis by altering multiple signaling pathways.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25468715/'>Clinical impact of herpesvirus entry mediator expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a>  2014  &gt;1 and P&lt;0.05 were screened as DEGs (differentially expressed genes).

DETs screened from each disease group were then subjected to functional annotation using DAVID. Next, DETs from each group were used to construct individual interaction networks using the BIND database, followed by sub‑network mining using clusterONE. Significant functions of nodes in each sub‑network were also investigated. In total, 19 and 281 DETs were screened from the RA and OA groups, respectively, with only six common DETs. DETs from the RA and OA groups were enriched in 8 and 130 gene ontology (GO) terms, respectively, with four common GO terms, of which to were associated with phospholipase C (PLC) activity. In addition, DETs screened from the OA group were enriched in immune response‑associated GO terms, and those screened from the RA group were largely associated with biological processes linked with the cell cycle and chromosomes. Genes involved in PLC activity and its regulation were indicated to be altered in RA as well as in OA. Alterations in the expression of cell cycle‑associated genes were indicated to be linked with the occurrence of OA, while genes participating in the immune response were involved in the occurrence of RA.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27341345/'>Molecular signatures of ovarian diseases: Insights from network medicine perspective.</a> April 5  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27839629/'>NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 goes to the beach.</a> November 15  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28546514/'>The nuclear matrix protein CIZ1 facilitates localization of Xist RNA to the inactive X-chromosome territory.</a> May 27  2017<br></body></html>
