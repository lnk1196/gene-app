The cluster analysis of these DEGs showed that 4 genes, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DQA1), HLA-DRB4, integrin 3 (ITGB3) and killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily F member 1 (KLRF1) were all significantly expressed in 3 groups, which were significantly enriched in asthma, T1D and intestinal immune network for IgA production pathway. And 57 genes enriched in cluster 5, which were only differentially expressed in NEW group, were involved in response to wounding, inflammatory response and blood coagulation as well as chemokine signaling pathway. Besides, the hub genes in PPI network of cluster 5 were identified, containing FOS, pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), interleukin 8 (IL8), formyl peptide receptor-like 2 (FPR2) and platelet factor 4 (PF4).HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB4, ITGB3 and KLRF1 might be targets for treatment of T1D, and 5 hub proteins, FOS, PPBP, IL8, FPR2 and PF4, were likely to be new markers for diagnosis of T1D.<br></body></html>
