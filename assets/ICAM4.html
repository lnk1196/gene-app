Then, differentially co-expressed genes (DCGs) and differentially co-expressed links (DCLs) were screened with q&lt;0.25 by the differential coexpression analysis and differential regulation analysis of gene expression microarray data package. Secondly, pathway enrichment analysis for DCGs was performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the DCLs associated with RA were selected by comparing the obtained DCLs with known transcription factor (TF)-targets in the TRANSFAC database. Finally, the obtained TFs were mapped to the known TF-targets to construct the network using cytoscape software. A total of 1755 DEGs, 457 DCGs and 101988 DCLs were achieved and there were 20 TFs in the obtained six TF-target relations (STAT3-TNF, PBX1‑PLAU, SOCS3-STAT3, GATA1-ETS2, ETS1-ICAM4 and CEBPE‑GATA1) and 457 DCGs. A number of TF-target relations in the constructed network were not within DCLs when the TF and target gene were DCGs. The identified TFs may have an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for RA.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27021335/'>Genetic association study of systemic lupus erythematosus and disease subphenotypes in European populations.</a> February 10  2016<br></body></html>
