Then Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses were performed for these DEGs in two groups, followed by the construction of weight PPI (protein-protein interaction) networks. Subnets enriched for the PPIs and differentially expressed genes were constructed based on the weight PPI networks. The overlapping genes between the genes in the top 10 subnets with smallest p value and the DEGs were selected as the candidate genes of disease. A total of 75 DEGs were identified in UC group and 87 ones in CD group. There were 69 and 57 specific DEGs in CD group and UC group, respectively. The DEGs in CD group were mainly enriched in &quot;inflammatory response&quot; and &quot;defense response&quot;, while the most significantly enriched GO terms in UC group were &quot;anion transport&quot; and &quot;chemotaxis&quot;. FOS and SOCS3 were identified as candidate genes for CD and other three genes HELB, ZBTB16 and FAM107A were candidate genes for UC. In conclusion, there were distinct genetic alterations between UC and CD. The candidate genes identified in current study may be used as biomarkers for differential diagnosis of CD and UC.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25821988/'>G-protein-coupled receptors regulate autophagy by ZBTB16-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Atg14L.</a> January 15  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833398/'>PLZF regulates CCR6 and is critical for the acquisition and maintenance of the Th17 phenotype in human cells.</a> July 1  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901025/'>AZFc deletions do not affect the function of human spermatogonia in vitro.</a> April 22  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25918132/'>Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Loci Associated With Diisocyanate-Induced Occupational Asthma.</a> April 8  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25990457/'>Regulation of AURKC expression by CpG island methylation in human cancer cells.</a> January 27  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26000489/'>Integrative clinical genomics of advanced prostate cancer.</a> July 30  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26121690/'>NLRP7, Involved in Hydatidiform Molar Pregnancy (HYDM1), Interacts with the Transcriptional Repressor ZBTB16.</a> March 30  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676652/'>Concise Review: Balancing Stem Cell Self-Renewal and Differentiation with PLZF.</a> November 1  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676643/'>Naïve Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Generated From β-Thalassemia Fibroblasts Allow Efficient Gene Correction With CRISPR/Cas9.</a> March 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26719025/'>Zebrafish Plzf transcription factors enhance early type I IFN response induced by two non-enveloped RNA viruses.</a> October 22  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26719025/'>Zebrafish Plzf transcription factors enhance early type I IFN response induced by two non-enveloped RNA viruses.</a> October 22  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26899660/'>Chronic TCDD exposure results in the dysregulation of gene expression in splenic B-lymphocytes and in the impairments in T-cell and B-cell differentiation in mouse model.</a> December 15  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27108396/'>Genome-wide analysis of gene expression during adipogenesis in human adipose-derived stromal cells reveals novel patterns of gene expression during adipocyte differentiation.</a> April 25  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27168161/'>Identification of Novel EZH2 Targets Regulating Osteogenic Differentiation in Mesenchymal Stem Cells.</a> May 12  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335174/'>ZBTB16 as a Downstream Target Gene of Osterix Regulates Osteoblastogenesis of Human Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.</a> June 24  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28116096/'>An inhaled dose of budesonide induces genes involved in transcription and signaling in the human airways: enhancement of anti- and proinflammatory effector genes.</a> January 25  2017<br></body></html>
