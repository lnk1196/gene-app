Functional annotation indicated that these genes are involved in cellular processes relevant to the cancer phenotype, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair, proteolysis, protease inhibition, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Six of the identified transcripts map to intronic regions of protein-coding genes and may comprise non-annotated exons or as yet uncharacterized long ncRNAs with a regulatory role in the gene expression program of larynx tissue. The differential expression of 10 of these genes (ADCY6, AES, AL2SCR3, CRR9, CSTB, DUSP1, MAP3K5, PLAT, UBL1 and ZNF706) was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Among these, the CSTB gene product has cysteine protease inhibitor activity that has been associated with an antimetastatic function. Interestingly, CSTB showed a low expression in the tumor samples analyzed (p&lt;0.0001). The set of genes identified here contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of larynx cancer, and provide candidate markers for improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this carcinoma.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24366883/'>CRR9/CLPTM1L regulates cell survival signaling and is required for Ras transformation and lung tumorigenesis.</a> April 23  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24651484/'>A prostate cancer model build by a novel SVM-ID3 hybrid feature selection method using both genotyping and phenotype data from dbGaP.</a> December 23  2014<br></body></html>
