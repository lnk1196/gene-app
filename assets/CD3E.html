Furthermore, interaction network and sub-network of these of these DEGs were constructed by NetBox. Linker genes were screened in the Global Network database. The degree of linker genes were calculated by igraph package in R language. Gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed for DEGs and network modules. A total of 246 DEGs were identified in MI, which were enriched in the immune response. In the interaction network, LCK, CD247, CD3D, FYN, HLA-DRA, IL2, CD8A CD3E, CD4, CD3G had high degree, among which CD3E, CD4, CD3G were DEGs while others were linker genes screened from Global Network database. Genes in the sub-network were also enriched in the immune response pathway. The genes with high degree may be biomarkers for MI diagnosis and therapy.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25917613/'>NFKB1 common variants and PPP1R13L and CD3EAP in relation to lung cancer risk in a Chinese population.</a> August 12  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25946140/'>Differentially expressed gene transcripts using RNA sequencing from the blood of immunosuppressed kidney allograft recipients.</a> April 26  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26563375/'>Association and interaction of NFKB1 rs28362491 insertion/deletion ATTG polymorphism and PPP1R13L and CD3EAP related to lung cancer risk in a Chinese population.</a> February 2  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26681190/'>Genetic Polymorphisms in XRCC1, CD3EAP, PPP1R13L, XPB, XPC, and XPF and the Risk of Chronic Benzene Poisoning in a Chinese Occupational Population.</a> June 28  2015<br></body></html>
