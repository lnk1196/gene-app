The methylation levels of these sites were significantly correlated between blood and saliva. The absolute levels of methylation in blood and saliva were confirmed for 3 selected DMS in the PM20D1, STK32C, and FGFR2 genes using pyrosequencing analysis. The differential methylation could only be confirmed for DMS in PM20D1 and STK32C genes in saliva. We show that saliva can be used for genome-wide methylation analysis and that it is possible to identify DMS when comparing RA cases and healthy controls. The results were replicated in blood cells of the same individuals and confirmed by pyrosequencing analysis. This study provides proof-of-concept for the applicability of saliva-based whole-genome methylation analysis in the field of respiratory allergy.  &gt;0.2), though the methylation status of about 96% of the cg-sites was comparable between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva. When comparing RA cases with healthy controls, the number of differentially methylated sites (DMS) in saliva and blood were 485 and 437 (P&lt;0.05 and <br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27323854/'>Tobacco smoking and methylation of genes related to lung cancer development.</a> June 22  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27797806/'>Genome-wide association study in essential tremor identifies three new loci.</a> November 1  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27797776/'>PhenoCurve: capturing dynamic phenotype-environment relationships using phenomics data.</a> November 1  2016<br></body></html>
