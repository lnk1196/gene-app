Furthermore, interaction network and sub-network of these of these DEGs were constructed by NetBox. Linker genes were screened in the Global Network database. The degree of linker genes were calculated by igraph package in R language. Gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed for DEGs and network modules. A total of 246 DEGs were identified in MI, which were enriched in the immune response. In the interaction network, LCK, CD247, CD3D, FYN, HLA-DRA, IL2, CD8A CD3E, CD4, CD3G had high degree, among which CD3E, CD4, CD3G were DEGs while others were linker genes screened from Global Network database. Genes in the sub-network were also enriched in the immune response pathway. The genes with high degree may be biomarkers for MI diagnosis and therapy.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24910257/'>CD3G gene defects in familial autoimmune thyroiditis.</a> January 13  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26148331/'>The expression of B &amp; T cell activation markers in children's tonsils following live attenuated influenza vaccine.</a> May 10  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26148245/'>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a potential consequence of tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor therapy.</a> June 3  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26300304/'>InÂ vivo immunotoxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate in BALB/c mice: Identification of T-cell receptor and calcium-mediated signaling pathway disruption through gene expression profiling of the spleen.</a> March 16  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28026094/'>Phenotypic characteristics of aged CD4(+) CD28(null) T lymphocytes are determined by changes in the whole-genome DNA methylation pattern.</a> December 28  2016<br></body></html>
