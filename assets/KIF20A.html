Several genes which responded with high expression levels (&gt;2 fold) included KIF20A, NEFM, C7orf10, HIST1H2BD, BMP6, and HIST1H2AC. Among the high expressing genes, five (CCNB2, BUB1, NEK2, CDC20, AURKA) were also differentially expressed at the medium (1.0 Gy) dose however, these genes were unmodulated following exposure to X-irradiation. Networks of these genes clustered around tumor protein-53 and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. This study has identified some potential gene /protein responses and networks that may be validated further to confirm their specificity and potential to be signature biomarkers of Î±-particle exposure.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23284628/'>The ETS transcription factors ELK1 and GABPA regulate different gene networks to control MCF10A breast epithelial cell migration.</a> June 19  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23369406/'>Short and long term gene expression variation and networking in human proximal tubule cells when exposed to cadmium.</a> August 13  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23369358/'>Exploring the pathogenetic association between schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus diseases based on pathway analysis.</a> August 13  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23369322/'>HDAM: a resource of human disease associated mutations from next generation sequencing studies.</a> August 13  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23369292/'>Development of a novel DNA sequencing method not only for hepatitis B virus genotyping but also for drug resistant mutation detection.</a> August 13  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327603/'>Impaired angiogenesis and tumor development by inhibition of the mitotic kinesin Eg5.</a> November 13  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327573/'>Effects of hepatocyte growth factor in myocarditis rats induced by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin.</a> October 15  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327568/'>A 4-MicroRNA signature can discriminate primary lymphomas from anaplastic carcinomas in thyroid cytology smears.</a> June 4  2013<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25118993/'>Downregulated CXCL12 expression in mesenchymal stem cells associated with severe aplastic anemia in children.</a> March 21  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25264741/'>Combinatorial measurement of CDKN1A/p21 and KIF20A expression for discrimination of DNA damage-induced clastogenicity.</a> June 4  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961928/'>Paclitaxel targets FOXM1 to regulate KIF20A in mitotic catastrophe and breast cancer paclitaxel resistance.</a> July 20  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26095524/'>XI-006 induces potent p53-independent apoptosis in Ewing sarcoma.</a> June 1  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26151199/'>Identification of genes associated with osteoarthritis by microarray analysis.</a> June 28  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26151196/'>Histone deacetylase inhibitor restores surfactant protein-C expression in alveolar-epithelial type II cells and attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo.</a> June 16  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26778408/'>Cell culture density affects the proliferation activity of human adipose tissue stem cells.</a> October 21  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27036048/'>Aberrantly activated Gli2-KIF20A axis is crucial for growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and predicts poor prognosis.</a> April 2  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27941992/'>High Expression of KIF20A Is Associated with Poor Overall Survival and Tumor Progression in Early-Stage Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a> December 13  2016<br></body></html>
