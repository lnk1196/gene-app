Then, differentially co-expressed genes (DCGs) and differentially co-expressed links (DCLs) were screened with q&lt;0.25 by the differential coexpression analysis and differential regulation analysis of gene expression microarray data package. Secondly, pathway enrichment analysis for DCGs was performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the DCLs associated with RA were selected by comparing the obtained DCLs with known transcription factor (TF)-targets in the TRANSFAC database. Finally, the obtained TFs were mapped to the known TF-targets to construct the network using cytoscape software. A total of 1755 DEGs, 457 DCGs and 101988 DCLs were achieved and there were 20 TFs in the obtained six TF-target relations (STAT3-TNF, PBX1‑PLAU, SOCS3-STAT3, GATA1-ETS2, ETS1-ICAM4 and CEBPE‑GATA1) and 457 DCGs. A number of TF-target relations in the constructed network were not within DCLs when the TF and target gene were DCGs. The identified TFs may have an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for RA.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25150625/'>Concordant B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in non-twinned siblings.</a> July 30  2014<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25761407/'>Association of genetic variation in IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE and surrogates for early-life infections with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanic children.</a> March 22  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25938438/'>Association between CEBPE Variant and Childhood Acute Leukemia Risk: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis of 22 Studies.</a> February 4  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26374622/'>Identification and functional analysis of acute myeloid leukemia susceptibility associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at non-protein coding regions of RUNX1.</a> January 7  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26575185/'>Somatic Mutation Allelic Ratio Test Using ddPCR (SMART-ddPCR): An Accurate Method for Assessment of Preferential Allelic Imbalance in Tumor DNA.</a> June 29  2015<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644650/'>Association of Genetic Variants in ARID5B, IKZF1 and CEBPE with Risk of Childhood de novo B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in India.</a> February 6  2016<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158719/'>Genome-wide association of white blood cell counts in Hispanic/Latino Americans: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.</a> February 4  2017<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28369034/'>SMARCD2 subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes mediates granulopoiesis through a CEBPɛ dependent mechanism.</a> April 4  2017<br></body></html>
