No significant population stratification was found for any SNP/phenotype. In single-locus analyses, evidence of association was observed for Lys656Asn with lean mass (P = 0.002) and fat mass (P = 0.015). The contribution of this polymorphism to the phenotypic variation of lean mass and fat mass was 2.63% and 1.15%, respectively. Subjects carrying allele G at the Lys656Asn site had, on average, 3.16% higher lean mass and 2.71% higher fat mass than those without it. In the analyses for haplotypes defined by the three SNPs, significant associations were detected between haplotype GCA (P = 0.005) and lean mass. In addition, marginally significant evidence of association was observed for this haplotype with fat mass (P = 0.012). No statistically significant linkage was found, largely due to the limited power of the linkage approach to detect small genetic effects in our data sets. Our results suggest that the LEPR gene polymorphisms contribute to variation in obesity phenotypes.<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15001640/'>Peritoneal macrophages induce RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) chemokine gene transcription in endometrial stromal cells.</a> March 6  2004<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15077163/'>PRDM5 is silenced in human cancers and has growth suppressive activities.</a> April 13  2004<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15569759/'>Malformation of cortical and vascular development in one family with parietal foramina determined by an ALX4 homeobox gene mutation.</a> December 1  2004<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15569717/'>Alcohol and gene expression in the central nervous system.</a> December 1  2004<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15870396/'>Linkage and association analyses of the UCP3 gene with obesity phenotypes in Caucasian families.</a> May 5  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15910756/'>Linkage exclusion analysis of two candidate regions on chromosomes 7 and 11: leptin and UCP2/UCP3 are not QTLs for obesity in US Caucasians.</a> May 25  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16319823/'>Enlarged parietal foramina caused by mutations in the homeobox genes ALX4 and MSX2: from genotype to phenotype.</a> December 2  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16319822/'>Global gene profiling reveals novel glucocorticoid induced changes in gene expression of human lens epithelial cells.</a> December 2  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16319821/'>Association of a common coding polymorphism (N453S) of the cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) gene with optic disc cupping and visual field alteration in French patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.</a> December 2  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16319817/'>A variant form of Oguchi disease mapped to 13q34 associated with partial deletion of GRK1 gene.</a> December 2  2005<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16849328/'>pfmdr2 confers heavy metal resistance to Plasmodium falciparum.</a> July 20  2006<br><a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16960694/'>Is a gene important for bone resorption a candidate for obesity?
